## Advent of Code 2025

This year I am doing Advent of Code in Haskell to learn functional programming. I will try to make every recursive function use tail-call recursion when possible.

I will also rate difficulty out of 10 and write what technique I used.

| Day | Part One | Technique Two | Difficulty
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Iteration | Iteration | 0/10, 1/10
